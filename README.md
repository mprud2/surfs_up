# surfs_up
Module 9 work with SQLite, SQL Alchemy, and Flask

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to investigate the weather patterns on the island of Oahu to determine whether it is conducive to opening an ice cream and surf shop on the island, named Surf n' Shake.  One of the potential investors asked us to investigate a dataset of temperature and precipitation measurements from nine different weather stations on the island of Oahu.  Some of the primary concerns from this investor were whether it would rain too much or if the temperatures would not be favorable year-round.  

In order to conduct this analysis, we used SQLite to explore the data, SQLAlchemy to reflect the data into tables that we could query, Jupyter Notebook to create the code, and Flask to create a webpage where other potential investors can see the results.

### Data Sources and Tools Used
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Tools Used: Python SQL toolkit (SQLAlchemy), Object Relational Mapper, pandas, numpy
- Software: SQLlite, Python 3.7.13, Flask, Jupyter Notebook
- Deliverables: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, climate_analysis.ipynb
